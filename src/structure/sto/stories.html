      <q class="text">Well worth a return visit
        We visited Random on 14th August to celebrate a family birthday. This was the second time we visited this year as we had visited in previously in July with friends. The food was delicious- everyone was delighted with the portions even the hungry males. The service was friendly. In these times of COVID restrictions it also felt safe. We will be back on our next visit to Dingle. Would highly recommend this restaurant.</q>

      <q class="text">Excellent cooking with great ingredients & robust flavours
        Looking for something a little different in Dingle? Random is a real find in a town where there is lots of great food but many menus look similar. Modern cooking with a twist here but not gimmicky. Portions are not small and there is good variety from a compact menu. There is no 'kids menu' as such but the restaurant is really accommodating and flexible in going 'off menu' for younger palates so you are sure to find something. Staff were very professional and welcoming from making the booking to the end of our meal. We went here on our last night of a week's holiday and will go back when we next visit Dingle.</q>
